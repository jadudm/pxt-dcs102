# DCS102

DCS102: Design of Computational Systems is a first course in programming, design thinking, and social issues in computing at Bates College. Part of the new program in Digital and Computational Studies, we are committed to equitable access to learning to think computationally across the full breadth of the liberal arts.

Sharing our work openly, wherever and whenever possible, is part of that commitment to justice and equity.
